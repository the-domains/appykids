Follow the magic chalk with your finger as you learn to trace the Arabic alphabet with the help of animated arrows. Your child will smile as their efforts are rewarded with a playground scene where the animated Arabic Alphabet letters come to life! Watch as the the_tineen_(dragon) blows fire, the_ghorilla_(gorilla) goes bananas and the_sarukh_(rocket) prepares for take off and many more special animated playground scenes.

This writing game teaches fundamental writing concepts to preschoolers: identifying letters, reading letter symbols, and associating letters with words.

### OBSERVE

The Arabic word associated with the chosen Arabic alphabet letter morph into a fun, animated cartoon! Then watch as the magic chalk traces the Arabic letter to show you the correct way to form each alphabet.

### IMITATE

The animated Arabic alphabet cartoon character by writing freehand with the magic chalk. Be mesmerized as the asad (lion) roars, the huut (whale) swims in the sea and the tayara (airplane) flies through the sky with Zee as their fellow adventurer.

### DEMONSTRATE

That you know how to write the Arabic letter to go to the playground scene where the characters come to life! The unstructured tracing reinforces motor-skills and commits the written Arabic letter to memory through repetition and multisensory cues.
